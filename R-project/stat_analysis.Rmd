## Data Loading and Cleaning

```{r data-loading}
# Load the dataset
data <- readr::read_csv("copy_data/sdg_3.csv") 
# tested to check if variables are correct, make data into one file with column of SDG-number
# r project currently give errors until data and variables are fixed! 

# Inspect the data structure
str(data)
summary(data)
```

## Descriptive Analysis

```{r stat 1}
# Boxplot for Likeability by Condition
ggplot(data, aes(x = Condition, y = Likeability, fill = Condition)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 3, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Likeability by Condition", x = "Condition", y = "Likeability") +
  theme_minimal()

```


```{r stat 2}
# Boxplot for Likeability by Condition
ggplot(data, aes(x = Condition, y = Perceived.Intelligence, fill = Condition)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 3, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Perceived Intelligence by Condition", x = "Condition", y = "Perceived Intelligence") +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Statistical Analysis

```{r stat test 1}
# Perform t-test
likeability_ttest <- t.test(Likeability ~ Condition, data = data)
print(likeability_ttest)

# Calculate SD for Delay group
sd_delay <- sd(data$Likeability[data$Condition == "Delay"])

# Calculate SD for No Delay group
sd_no_delay <- sd(data$Likeability[data$Condition == "No Delay"])

# Print results
cat("SD for Delay group:", sd_delay, "\n")
cat("SD for No Delay group:", sd_no_delay, "\n")
```


```{r stat test 2}
# Perform t-test
intelligence_ttest <- t.test(Perceived.Intelligence ~ Condition, data = data)
print(intelligence_ttest)

# Calculate SD for Delay group
sd_delay <- sd(data$Perceived.Intelligence[data$Condition == "Delay"])

# Calculate SD for No Delay group
sd_no_delay <- sd(data$Perceived.Intelligence[data$Condition == "No Delay"])

# Print results
cat("SD for Delay group:", sd_delay, "\n")
cat("SD for No Delay group:", sd_no_delay, "\n")
```
