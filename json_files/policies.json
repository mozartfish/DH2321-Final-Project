To control emissions of F-gases, the EU adopted in 2006 the F-gas Regulation (842\/2006), intended to control the production and the consumption of F-gases and incentivize the use of alternatives with less impact on climate change. In 2014, the original F-gases Regulation was replaced by Regulation 517\/2014, which strengthen the existent measures and introduced new provisions on F-gases consumption and production, applicable from 2015. The main provisions of the new F-gases Regulation are the following:\n- Limitation of the total amount of gases that can be sold in the EU, with the target of reaching an amount of one-fifth of 2014 sales.\n- Banning the use of F-gases in certain application where less harmful alternatives are available in the market.\n- Preventing the emissions from existent equipment by enhanced maintenance, quality control checks and recovery of gases.\nThe F-gases regulation impacts on the future evolution of GHG emissions in the following IPCC categories:\n- Commercial refrigeration and Industrial refrigeration\n- Stationary air conditionning\n- Transport refrigeration\n- Foam blowing agents \u2013 closed cells Fire protection\n- Technical aerosols","status":"Implemented","sector":"Industrial processes","source":"https:\/\/discomap.eea.europa.eu\/map\/GHG_PAMS\/Belgium.pdf"},{"country":"Belgium","year":2019,"policy":"Green OLO's\/ Green Bonds","description":"OLO is the Belgian abbreviation for 'Obligation Lin\u00e9aire\/Lineaire Obligatie'.

This is the aim of the federal funding for energy consulting in SMEs (EBM). The federal government provides grants to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) take advantage of qualified energy consulting services. They are an important instrument for reducing information deficits, identifying savings potential and demonstrating measures for improving energy efficiency in the company. The starting points for energy consulting are the areas of buildings and systems as well as user behavior; the proposed measures should be based on the principle of economic efficiency. If the use of renewable energies appears to make sense, this should be pointed out in particular and, if necessary, a corresponding concept should be developed; this also applies to the use of waste heat.","status":"Implemented","sector":"Energy consumption","source":"https:\/\/discomap.eea.europa.eu\/map\/GHG_PAMS\/Germany.pdf"},{"country":"Germany","year":2008,"policy":"Electricity saving check","description":"The electricity savings check is a project within the framework of the NKI of the BMWK.

Reykjav\u00edk Energy (Orkuveita Reykjav\u00edkur) has developed the method in collaboration with the University of Iceland and foreign stakeholders and it has received widespread attention around the world. The method involves capturing CO2 from geothermal emissions. The CO2 dissolves in water under pressure and the water is subsequently pumped to a depth of 500-800 meters into the basalt strata, where the CO2 is permanently mineralized. The gas is, in this way, turned into rock.

Participation is voluntary, and Iceland will choose to participate from the beginning along with other countries that are a part of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). First, emissions from 2019 will be used as a baseline for emissions, and it will be mandatory to carbon offset all emissions that are in excess of the baseline in the following years. Then two three year periods begin (2021-2023 and 2024-2026) when all countries can participate voluntarily before participation becomes binding. Currently, 88 countries have committed themselves to participate voluntarily from 2021 to 2026. From the start of 2019, flight operators from these countries have been monitoring CO2 emissions from international aviation. The CORSIA system will be implemented in Iceland through the ETS with changes in legislation on climate issues.","status":"Implemented","sector":"Transport","source":"https:\/\/discomap.eea.europa.eu\/map\/GHG_PAMS\/Iceland.pdf"},{"country":"Iceland","year":2019,"policy":"Climate education in schools","description":"Since the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) was released the education material which is already available in Iceland has been mapped, with the goal of determining what kind of material is missing and where improvements can be made.

The policy update focuses on how the planning of municipalities can purposefully support the achievement of the government\u2019s climate, landscape, and public health targets. In the update, guidance is proposed on how municipalities can use long-term planning strategies to shape the development of land use and the built environment, both in rural and urban areas. The policy expects municipalities to form a policy on climate focused planning, for planning to support the achievement of carbon neutrality, and to strengthen resilience against climate change through various adaptation measures. In climate focused planning, climate goals are prioritised when settlements and land-use changes are being planned. In this way, planning can be used to support improved commuting behaviour, climate friendly construction, and the preservation and sequestration of carbon in soils and flora, for example .\nThe measure is connected to various other measures in the Action Plan, such as Measures 601, 602, and 604 on supporting forestry, land, and wetland reclamation, and measures 205, 206, and 209 on changed travel habits, active modes of transportation, and the strengthening of the public transport system.","status":"Implemented","sector":"Other sectors","source":"https:\/\/discomap.eea.europa.eu\/map\/GHG_PAMS\/Iceland.pdf"},{"country":"Iceland","year":2020,"policy":"Climate impact of the construction industry","description":"Identify opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building industry.

After the first edition of the Climate Action Plan (2018) was published, the Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate initiated a lot of research into the climate- and environmental impacts of the construction industry.

Sur les premi\u00e8res, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9tatiques, des limitations \u00e0 30 km\/h restent possibles sur des tron\u00e7ons de quelque 200 m\u00e8tres au niveau de centralit\u00e9s ou d\u2019\u00e9coles. A la demande des communes et sous condition qu\u2019elles les r\u00e9am\u00e9nagent en cons\u00e9quence, les routes de distribution \u00e9tatiques pourront \u00eatre apais\u00e9es sur des sections bien plus longues.

The objective of this policy is to boost energy savings by putting an incentive on reducing the consumption of gas and electricity, which should direct consumers toward more energy efficient behaviour. More recent CO2 reduction became more important, resulting e.g. in tariff shifts from electricity to gas. The energy tax is levied a.o. on electricity and natural gas, and the level depends on the level of energy consumption of a customer (degressive tariff structure). There are some exemptions and refund options (under conditions) e.g. for companies that participate in Long Term Agreements on energy efficiency. In 2013 a surcharge system (ODE) was introduced in order to cover expenditures resulting from the sustainable energy production scheme. Also this system differentiates between levels of energy use and between type of users (e.g. companies or dwellings). In 2020 through some shifts, the relative contribution to the ODE by dwellings was limited and that of many companies increased. Since 2023, the sustainable energy surcharge (ODE) will no longer be levied, because from now on the subsidy for sustainable energy will be financed from the general budget.","status":"Implemented","sector":"Energy consumption","source":"https:\/\/discomap.eea.europa.eu\/map\/GHG_PAMS\/Netherlands.pdf"},{"country":"Netherlands","year":1997,"policy":"EIA Energy Investment Tax Allowance scheme","description":"Deduction scheme from fiscal profits to promote investments in new energy efficient technologies.

In the case of introduction and application of appropriate socio-economic and ecosystem measures and PES schemes (payments for ecosystem services), the acreage in this category could be stabilized and its use improved.","status":"Planned","sector":"LULUCF","source":"https:\/\/discomap.eea.europa.eu\/map\/GHG_PAMS\/Slovakia.pdf"},{"country":"Slovakia","year":2021,"policy":"Improving sustainable forest management","description":"The objective of this measure is a support for forest practices improvement, which will lead to increased carbon sequestration in the context of sustainable forest management.

This involves the installation of gas drainage trenches into the cap of a landfill, which direct the landfill gas into a layer of material consisting of compost and shredded wood and timber, referred to as a biofilter.
